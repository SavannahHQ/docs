# Slack Source

In order to add a Slack source to your Savannah community you will need to add the Savannah app to your Slack workspace. If your user account doesn't have permission to add Slack apps it will send a request to your workspace admins. Once permission is granted you will be able to finish adding it to Savannah.

## Channels

The Slack source will allow you to track any of your public Slack channels, and any private or shared channels that your user account has permissions to read.
