# Stack Exchange Source

Adding a Stack Exchange source requires you to authenticate with Stack Exchange. 

Once you have authenticated with Stack Exchange, Savannah will ask you which of the sites you are a member of you want to use. Stack Overflow is the most popular of these sites.

## Channels

Because Stack Exchange sites do not have a concept of channel or category, Savannah uses their concept of Tags instead. You can choose to track one or more of these tags in Savannah. 

> If a question uses more than one of the tags that you are tracking, it will be imported only under the first such tag that it's found, to avoid duplication in Savannah.
