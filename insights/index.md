# Gaining insights into your community

Metrics and data are great, but what are they actually telling you about your community? Learn what Savannah is telling, and how you should respond to that to keep it healthy and growing.

## Engagement Levels

Your Engagement Levels, either for your community as a whole or on a per-Project basis, contain significant information about the overall health of your community, the experience your members are having, and what may be holding you back from the kind of growth you want to see.

## Connections Network

The Network Graph of your [Connections page](../pages/connections/) is more than just a visualisation of how your community is interconnected, its shape and structure conveys deeper meanings about how your community is organizing itself. Identifying these meanings will help you know what actions to take to keep your community healthy and growing.
