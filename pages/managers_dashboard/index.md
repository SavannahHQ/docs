# Manager's Dashboard

The first page you see in Savannah CRM is not filled with graphs and numbers, instead you will be shown information about the current state of your community and what actions you need to take. Let's take a look at each element one at a time.

## Source Activity

![Source Activity](/images/managers_dashboard/sources.png)

At the very top of your dashboard will be a list of the various locations (Sources in Savannah) where your community activity happens, in the order of most active to least active. For each you will see a percentage showing the relative activity level in that location over the previous 7 days, compared to the average for the month before that. This will show you which locations have been more active recently, and which have been less active and may need your attention. Those at 120% or more will be colored green to indicate high performance, while those at 80% or less will be colored red to indicate low performance.

## Open Tasks

## Contribution Opportunities
